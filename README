A kind of StackOverFlow platform where developers can ask help to debug their codes.
I create this web app during the Hackathon Facebook developer circles in Kigali.
The challenge was to build something to help developers to improve their crafts,improve their skills.
Facebook tools used:
	Account kit(Log by SMS or EMAIL)
In a future commit i will add a bot messenger.

To use the platform with your own Facebook App don't forget to change App_id and App_secret in
login_success.php and in the directory templates/template1.php
