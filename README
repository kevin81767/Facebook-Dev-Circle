A kind of StackOverFlow platform where developers can ask help to debug theirs codes.
I create this web app during the Hackathon Facebook developer circles in Kigali.
The challenge was to build something to help developers to improve their crafts,improve their skills.
Facebook tools used:
	Account kit(Log by SMS or EMAIL)
